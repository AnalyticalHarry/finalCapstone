Capstone Project VII: Unsupervised Machine Learning

This repository performs a principal component analysis on the well-known USArrests dataset. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most relevant variables. The analysis employs Kmeans and hierarchical clustering methods to visually represent the results.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the USArrests dataset in order to simplify its complexity and retain important trends and patterns. The reduced dimensionality allows for an easier interpretation of the data and can significantly enhance the accuracy of predictive models.

Installation: To execute the code, one can start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook, upload the IPython Notebook file and run the cells. This will allow for an interactive execution of the code in a web-based interface.
